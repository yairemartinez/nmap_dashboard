This file is generated and used at runtime for main logging.

- It is included here to show the expected log file name and location.
- It may be owned by root if the Docker container or app is run with `sudo`.
- This is expected behavior due to the nature of Nmap scans.
- Contents are cleared before commit; no sensitive data is included.

If running into permission errors, ensure you're using Docker with `sudo` as required.
