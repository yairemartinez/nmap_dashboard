⚠️ Security Warning
This tool is for **private use on trusted networks** only.
Do **not** expose the container to the public internet or run on unknown devices.


⚠️ This app requires Docker to be run with sudo:
This is necessary because:
- Nmap needs raw socket access, which requires elevated privileges.
- Log files (`logs/nmap_dashboard.log`) are owned by root for security.
- The app runs in Docker containers as root by design.

If running app on docker edit app/routes/run_scan.py line 63 remove "sudo"(already done when posted)
TARGET IS HARDCODED line 34 app/routes/run_scan.py


# Nmap Dashboard
A self-contained, Flask-powered Nmap scanning dashboard for managing, visualizing, tagging, and comparing network scan results.
Built for personal network reconnaissance. Dockerized for portability. No external dependencies required beyond Docker.

Features
- View and manage Nmap scan results through a web UI
- Tag devices and ports with custom labels
- Compare scans over time and track changes
- Export results to PDF
- Undo deletions and recover orphaned data
- Built-in support for custom device tracking
- Fully containerized with Docker

nmap_dashboard/
- app/ # All Flask route modules, templates, and utilities
- archive/ # Archived scan data or backups
- scans/ # XML (.xml) and plain text (.txt) scan outputs
- logs/ # App logs written by logging module
- scripts/ # Standalone backend scripts (not part of the dashboard UI)
- nmap_results.db # SQLite database storing scan + tag data
- Dockerfile # Docker image definition (installs Nmap + Flask app)
- docker-compose.yml # Orchestrates container with volume/network config
- requirements.txt # Python dependencies
- .dockerignore # Files to ignore when building Docker image
- .gitignore # Files to ignore from Git tracking
- .env.example # Secret config variables (SECRET_KEY, etc.)
- gunicorn.conf.py # Gunicorn server configuration for production
- wsgi.py # Gunicorn entrypoint for Flask app
- run.py # Dev-only script to launch app manually with Flask



# Development Tips
If you're not using Docker (for development only):
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 run.py

# Secrets are read from .env: YOU HAVE TO CREATE ONE
SECRET_KEY=replace-this-key
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Getting Started (with Docker) Requirements
- Docker v20+
- Linux-based OS (needed for `--network host` support)
- Open port 5050 (or change it in the Dockerfile)


# Docker Compose Explained
Here’s what Docker does under the hood:
Builds the image from Dockerfile
Installs latest Nmap from source
Runs the Flask app via Gunicorn
Maps scans/, logs/, and your SQLite DB as volumes
Uses network_mode: host for raw socket support (Nmap)
Loads secrets from .env


# DOCKER 
USEFUL COMANDS FOR DOCKER
- CHECK DOCKER STATUS sudo docker ps
- CHECK DOCKER LOGS sudo docker compose logs -f


DOWNLOARDING DOCKER
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install docker.io -y
- sudo apt install docker-compose -y


DOCKER WITHOUT COMPOSE
1. sudo docker build -t nmap-dashboard .

2. sudo docker run -d \
  --name nmap-app \
  --network host \
  --cap-add=NET_RAW \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  -v $(pwd)/scans:/app/scans \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs \
  -v $(pwd)/nmap_results.db:/app/nmap_results.db \
  -v /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts:ro \
  -v /etc/resolv.conf:/etc/resolv.conf:ro \
  -e PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
  -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
  -e SECRET_KEY=replace-this-key \
  nmap-dashboard

3. sudo docker stop nmap-app

4. sudo docker rm nmap-app


My Setup for Compose
1. mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/

2. sudo curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 \
  -o /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose

3. sudo chmod +x /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose


DOCKERFILE WITH DOCKER COMPOSE
1. Build the Container Image
- sudo docker compose build
or
- sudo docker compose up --build

2. Start the Container
- sudo docker compose up -d

3. STOP THE APP
- sudo docker compose down
